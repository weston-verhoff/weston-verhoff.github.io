				Core Strengths & Skills
			</h2>
			<p>My core strengths lie in prototyping and design systems leadership. I’ve built <strong>scalable component libraries in Figma</strong>, documented best practices, and guided teams in adopting consistent, efficient workflows. Prototyping is another area where I thrive. Whether it’s wireframing early concepts or crafting high-fidelity flows that simulate the final experience, I focus on creating assets that accelerate collaboration and decision-making. <br><br>

			I also bring over <strong>a decade of experience in web development</strong> (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Java). While design is my primary focus, my development expertise acts as a bridge between design and engineering. I can anticipate technical constraints, speak the language of developers, and ensure that handoff is both smooth and realistic. This dual perspective lets me advocate for designs that are not only elegant but also implementable. <br><br>

			Recently, I’ve expanded into UX research to strengthen my end-to-end design practice. I’ve <strong>run surveys, analyzed results, and am currently moderating usability tests</strong> to gather actionable insights. These experiences have sharpened my ability to connect user feedback with design decisions, and I’m motivated to grow further in this direction. <br><br>

			In practice, I bring more than just top-tier design and development skills to my work; colleagues describe me as <strong>collaborative, adaptable, and persistent</strong>. I value open communication and believe the best work comes from helping teams connect dots across disciplines. To me, that means <strong>mentoring junior designers, facilitating discussions</strong> between product and engineering teams, and <strong>staying flexible when projects evolve</strong>. I take pride in bringing a steady, constructive presence to teams, even under pressure, so that challenges turn into opportunities for alignment and progress.</p>

				I’m Weston Verhoff, a results-driven Product Designer with a passion for building scalable, user-centered design systems and crafting seamless digital experiences. With over four years of professional experience (most recently leading design efforts for Kohl’s enterprise-level design system), I specialize in bridging the gap between design and front-end development to deliver high-quality, accessible UI components. <br><br>

				Skilled in Figma, Adobe XD, and front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, I thrive in Agile environments where collaboration and rapid iteration drive success. I’ve mentored design teams, worked closely with developers and product managers, and consistently incorporated user feedback to create intuitive interfaces that align with business goals. <br><br>

				Beyond design, I bring leadership and collaboration skills, experience mentoring anyone interested in design, and a commitment to continuous learning. My background in UX communication design and a minor in business administration empower me to approach challenges holistically — balancing user needs, technical feasibility, and strategic impact. <br><br>

				When I’m not designing or coding, I’m likely lifting weights, cooking, reading, or working on pet projects like my <a href="https://ezextrack.netlify.app" class="underline" target="_blank">workout tracker</a>.
