      <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">About Me</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
				I’m Weston Verhoff, a results-driven Product Designer with a passion for building scalable, user-centered design systems and crafting seamless digital experiences. With over four years of professional experience — most recently leading design efforts for Kohl’s enterprise-level design system — I specialize in bridging the gap between design and front-end development to deliver high-quality, accessible UI components.

				Skilled in Figma, Adobe XD, and front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, I thrive in Agile environments where collaboration and rapid iteration drive success. I’ve mentored design teams, worked closely with developers and product managers, and consistently incorporated user feedback to create intuitive interfaces that align with business goals.

				Beyond design, I bring a foundation in interaction design, wireframing complex flows, and a commitment to continuous learning. My background in UX communication design and a minor in business administration empower me to approach challenges holistically — balancing user needs, technical feasibility, and strategic impact.

				When I’m not designing or coding, I’m likely lifting weights, cooking, reading, or working on pet projects like my <a href="https://ezextrack.netlify.app">workout tracker</a>.
