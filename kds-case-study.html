	      For more than 2 years, I was the primary custodian and contributor to the Kohl's Design System. Getting the system up to enterprise-standards was a tall order, but I was up to the task.

  <!-- Problem -->

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">The Problem</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
      When I was assigned to Kohl’s Design System (KDS), it had been defunct and abandoned for over two years. Although designers were expected to use it, there was no clear guidance or documentation. The Figma components were rigid, difficult to use, and the underlying codebase was outdated, making adoption frustrating and inconsistent across teams.
    </p>

  <!-- Process -->
  <section class="max-w-4xl mx-auto px-4 py-12 border-t border-gray-200">
    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">The Process</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      Tasked with revitalizing KDS and driving adoption, I partnered closely with the engineering team to update the codebase and ensure technical stability. I actively solicited feedback from design teams through weekly critiques to understand their needs, iterating on components until they were truly useful and easy to use. Overcoming a lack of leadership direction, I focused on making the design system better by empowering designers rather than enforcing usage.

  <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
    I redesigned and documented scalable Figma components tailored to real design workflows, including complex components like the product tile—crafted to handle every variation through modular subcomponents. I also implemented a feedback and requests form directly tied to our backlog, streamlining communication and saving time for both contributors and maintainers. <br> <strong>Here's what each of the components I created taught me: </strong>

		title="Designing with Constraints: The Button"
		desc="The button component was politically sensitive, with many departments wanting control over its appearance and behavior. To manage this, we minimized design input and instead focused on guidelines for what not to do—ensuring designers across the organization could use the button consistently without deviating from the design system.

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Results & Impact</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
      While precise metrics were hard to track, one metric I am proud of is that <strong>by the time I was finished, adoption reached 100%.</strong> When I started, adoption was only at 12%. Our Site Standards team could work more efficiently, thanks to alignment between updated KDS styles and the evolving site pages. The product tile component became a shared resource, adopted by multiple designers and featured in high-visibility patterns like product carousels and homepage recommendations.

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Reflection</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
      This project taught me the power of resourcefulness in the face of unclear authority and limited support. By focusing on usability and collaboration, I was able to inspire team members to care about and contribute to the system’s growth. Tackling the most complex component first—as advised by design system expert Dan Mall—helped pave the way for smoother development of all subsequent components, turning what felt like an uphill battle into meaningful progress.
