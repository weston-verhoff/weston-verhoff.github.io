  <!-- Problem -->
  <section class="max-w-4xl mx-auto px-4 py-12 border-t border-gray-200">
    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">The Problem</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
      I wanted a completely free, lightweight tool to track my weight consistently. Existing solutions were either paid, bloated with unnecessary features, or lacked local data storage. My goal was to create a minimalist tracker that ran on my local machine, saved day-by-day data, and allowed me to visualize trends, while also giving me the opportunity to learn Python and practice version control using GitHub.

  <!-- Process -->
  <section class="max-w-4xl mx-auto px-4 py-12 border-t border-gray-200">
    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">The Process</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
		I approached the project iteratively, starting with a simple proof-of-concept and gradually adding features based on testing and personal needs:</p>
		<ol class="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-4 mb-12 text-gray-700">
			<li><strong>Initial Development:</strong>Using GitHub and CoPilot, I built a basic Python script that allowed me to enter daily weights and save them to a CSV file.</li>
			<li><strong>Visualization: </strong>Added a chart feature to show trends in my weight over time, helping me interpret progress at a glance.</li>
			<li><strong>Data Management:</strong> While testing, I realized I needed the ability to edit or delete entries in case of mistakes or missing data, so I implemented those features.</li>
			<li><strong>Weekly Trend Line: </strong>Added a weekly average trend line to reduce noise from day-to-day fluctuations and make progress easier to interpret.</li>
			<li><strong>Display Order Adjustment: </strong>As the data grew, I reversed the display order to show the most recent entries first, improving usability for ongoing tracking.</li>
			<li><strong>Iterative Testing: </strong>Each new feature was tested by using the application for several days to ensure it met my needs effectively.</li>
		</ol>
  <!-- Solution -->
  <section class="max-w-4xl mx-auto px-4 py-12 border-t border-gray-200">
    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">The Solution</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      I designed and built a lightweight, user-friendly weight tracking application that enables seamless daily logging, visualization, and management of personal weight data. The app allows users to:
			<ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-4 mb-12 text-gray-700">
				<li>Enter daily weights quickly and save them to a CSV file for easy long-term storage.</li>
				<li>View progress through a dynamic chart, making trends immediately visible.</li>
				<li>Edit or delete entries to maintain accurate records.</li>
				<li>See a weekly average trend line that smooths out day-to-day fluctuations.</li>
				<li>Reverse the display order so the most recent entries are always at the top for quick reference.</li>
			</ul>
